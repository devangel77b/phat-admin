For electrical engineers:

Working in a team, student will help develop a phased array tracking system consisting of an amplifier board, data acquisition board, cabling, and host computer routines.  Students will be involved in schematic design, board layout, fabrication, and testing.  Students will prepare sufficient documentation to allow the design to be open source.  Students will build enough copies of device for testing, using through-hole and surface mount soldering techniques and other standard EE fabrication methods.  Students will aid in testing and will assist signal processing / software development as needed.  EE team members are responsible for device firmware. 



For signal processing / software:

Working in a team, student will write device driver (host computer side) and signal processing routines, and top level interface to run on the host computer and process data generated by the phased array tracking system hardware.  Students will be trained in good coding practices and modular system design.  Coding will be in C or Python and will make maximal use of open-source routines and libraries.  Signal processing will implement time domain or frequency domain processing of phased array acoustic measurements; may include maximum likelihood estimation of position, velocity, acceleration, and source characteristics; automated tracking; etc.
